You have to upload the images for the background of the website here, then rename the website according to "image" and then image number only in integer digits, followed by ".png" extension name and nothing else.
Eg. 
- image1.jpg
- image10.jpg

Also tweak the script.js file after changing the folder size, by uploading more images or deleting some of them, so as to limit the random image generator upto the new size of the folder.
